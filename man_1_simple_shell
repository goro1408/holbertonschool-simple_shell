.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "August 2024" "1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"
.SH NAME
simple_shell \- A basic command-line interpreter .

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell [command_file [argument ...]] [-al]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a command-line interpreter designed to facilitate interaction between the user and the operating system. It provides a simple interface for executing system commands and managing processes, similar to other Unix-like shells.

.PP
When launched,
.B simple_shell
operates in an interactive mode, presenting the user with a prompt where commands can be entered. The shell reads each command line input, tokenizes it into executable commands and arguments, and then interprets the input to determine the appropriate action. This can involve running built-in commands, executing external binaries, or managing shell-specific operations such as navigating directories or setting environment variables.

.PP
The shell supports the execution of any standard Unix command available on the system, as well as custom scripts and executables, provided they are in the user's `PATH`. When a command is issued, the shell creates a child process to execute the command, ensuring that the shell itself remains responsive to further input.

.PP
Key features of
.B simple_shell
include:
.TP
\(bu Handling of absolute and relative paths to execute commands, ensuring flexibility in command execution.
.TP
\(bu Environment variable support, enabling users to access and manipulate environment settings dynamically within the shell session.
.TP
\(bu Basic error handling and reporting, which informs the user of issues like command not found, permission denied, and invalid input.
.TP
\(bu An `exit` command that cleanly terminates the shell session, freeing any allocated resources and returning control to the parent process or terminal.
